# Crypto Orderbook/Distribution Signal

Orderbook and distribution signal for cryptocurrencies. Uses R to retrieve data from Coinbase websocket, format and upload it to a SQL Server which is then live streamed to a PowerBI dashboard. 

Could also try taking in user input in what crypto currencies (very difficult as not sure on how to link PowerBI to R?) to visualize as well as switch to a REST API or alternate websockets as Coinbase websocket is very unstable.
